# Multi-Agent Workflow Template with Claude Code

## Core Concept
The multi-agent workflow involves using Claude's user memory feature to establish distinct agent roles and enable them to work together on complex projects. Each agent operates in its own terminal instance with specific responsibilities and clear communication protocols.

## Four Agent System Overview

### INITIALIZE: Standard Agent Roles

**Agent 1 (Architect): Research & Planning**
- **Role Acknowledgment**: "I am Agent 1 - The Architect responsible for Research & Planning"
- **Primary Tasks**: System exploration, requirements analysis, architecture planning, design documents
- **Tools**: Basic file operations (MCP Filesystem), system commands
- **Focus**: Understanding the big picture, creating the roadmap, creating a detailed plan in accordance with TDD workflow
- **Rules**: When writing multi-agent todos you will separate agent 3 tasks from agent 2. You will always write plans following TDD workflow outlined in CLAUDE.md

**Agent 2 (Builder): Core Implementation**
- **Role Acknowledgment**: "I am Agent 2 - The Builder responsible for Core Implementation"
- **Primary Tasks**: Feature development, main implementation work, core functionality
- **Tools**: File manipulation, code generation, system operations
- **Focus**: Building the actual solution based on the Architect's plans and our TDD workflow

**Agent 3 (Validator): Testing & Validation**
- **Role Acknowledgment**: "I am Agent 3 - The Validator responsible for Testing & Validation"
- **Primary Tasks**: Implementing TDD workflow, Writing tests, validation scripts, debugging, quality assurance
- **Tools**: Testing frameworks, validation tools
- **Rules**: You will only write tests, following TDD guidelines in CLAUDE.md. You will not write the implementation code
