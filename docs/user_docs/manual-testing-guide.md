# Manual Testing Guide for Team Think MCP Server

This guide explains how to manually test the Team Think MCP Server to verify it's working correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have:

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **npm**: Installed with Node.js
- **Terminal/Command Line**: Access to run commands

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

From the project root directory:

```bash
cd "/path/to/team-think-mcp"
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Server

Build the shared package first, then the server:

```bash
# Build shared types package
npm run build:shared

# Build the MCP server
cd server
npm run build
```

You should see no TypeScript errors. The compiled JavaScript files will be in `server/dist/`.

## Manual Testing Methods

### Method 1: Using the Built-in Test Client (Recommended)

The easiest way to test the server is using the included test client:

```bash
cd server
npm run test
```

**Expected Output:**
```
ðŸš€ Starting MCP Server development tests...

Server log: 2025-06-11T14:20:33.142Z [INFO] [TeamThinkMCP] Team Think MCP Server started
Server log: 2025-06-11T14:20:33.146Z [INFO] [TeamThinkMCP] Starting MCP server...
Server log: 2025-06-11T14:20:33.146Z [INFO] [TeamThinkMCP] MCP server is ready to accept connections

ðŸ“¤ Testing: Initialize Request
âœ… Initialize Request - Response validation passed
ðŸ“¤ Testing: Initialized Notification
âœ… Initialized Notification - Notification sent
ðŸ“¤ Testing: Tools List Request
âœ… Tools List Request - Response validation passed
ðŸ“¤ Testing: Invalid Method Request
âœ… Invalid Method Request - Response validation passed

ðŸ›‘ Stopping server...

âœ… All tests completed successfully!
```

### Method 2: Manual Command Line Testing

For more detailed testing, you can manually send JSON-RPC messages to the server.

#### Step 1: Start the Server

In one terminal window:

```bash
cd server
npm run start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2025-06-11T14:20:33.142Z [INFO] [TeamThinkMCP] Team Think MCP Server started
2025-06-11T14:20:33.146Z [INFO] [TeamThinkMCP] Starting MCP server...
2025-06-11T14:20:33.146Z [INFO] [TeamThinkMCP] MCP server is ready to accept connections
```

The server is now listening for JSON-RPC messages on stdin.

#### Step 2: Send Test Messages

**Important**: All messages must be valid JSON on a single line, followed by Enter.

##### Test 1: Initialize Request

Type this exactly (all on one line):

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test-client","version":"1.0.0"}}}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{"tools":{}},"serverInfo":{"name":"team-think-mcp","version":"0.1.0"}}}
```

**Log Output:**
```
2025-06-11T14:20:57.765Z [INFO] [TeamThinkMCP] Handling initialize request from client: - test-client
```

##### Test 2: Initialized Notification

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialized","params":{}}
```

**Expected Response:** No JSON response (notifications don't get responses)

**Log Output:**
```
2025-06-11T14:20:57.766Z [INFO] [TeamThinkMCP] Received initialized notification, handshake complete
```

##### Test 3: Tools List Request

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"result":{"tools":[]}}
```

##### Test 4: Invalid Method (Error Handling Test)

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"invalid/method","params":{}}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"error":{"code":-32601,"message":"Method not found","data":"Unknown method: invalid/method"}}
```

##### Test 5: Malformed JSON (Error Handling Test)

```
{invalid json}
```

**Expected Response:** No response (cannot parse request ID)

**Log Output:**
```
2025-06-11T14:20:57.766Z [ERROR] [TeamThinkMCP] Error parsing JSON-RPC message: [SyntaxError details]
```

#### Step 3: Stop the Server

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully shutdown the server.

**Expected Output:**
```
2025-06-11T14:20:35.946Z [INFO] [TeamThinkMCP] Received SIGINT, shutting down gracefully...
2025-06-11T14:20:35.946Z [INFO] [TeamThinkMCP] Server shutdown complete
```

### Method 3: Using Echo and Pipes (Quick Test)

For a quick verification that the server responds to initialize:

```bash
cd server
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test-client","version":"1.0.0"}}}' | npm run start
```

You should see the initialize response immediately.

## Understanding the Output

### JSON-RPC Responses

All responses follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification:

- **Success Response**: Contains `"result"` field
- **Error Response**: Contains `"error"` field with `code`, `message`, and optional `data`
- **Notifications**: No response expected

### Log Messages

- **INFO**: Normal operation messages
- **ERROR**: Error conditions
- **WARN**: Warning conditions
- All logs go to stderr (not stdout) to avoid interfering with JSON-RPC communication

### Server Status Indicators

1. **"Team Think MCP Server started"** - Server process initialized
2. **"Starting MCP server..."** - Protocol handler starting
3. **"MCP server is ready to accept connections"** - Ready for JSON-RPC messages
4. **"Handling initialize request from client"** - Successfully processing MCP handshake

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Start

**Problem**: `npm run start` fails with module errors
**Solution**: 
1. Run `npm install` in the project root
2. Run `npm run build:shared` 
3. Run `npm run build` in the server directory

#### No Response to Messages

**Problem**: Server receives message but doesn't respond
**Solution**:
1. Ensure JSON is valid and on a single line
2. Check that the message includes required fields (`jsonrpc`, `id`, `method`)
3. Verify you pressed Enter after typing the message

#### Build Errors

**Problem**: TypeScript compilation fails
**Solution**:
1. Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Verify tsconfig.json files are not corrupted

#### Invalid JSON Error

**Problem**: "Error parsing JSON-RPC message"
**Solution**:
1. Validate JSON syntax using a JSON validator
2. Ensure the entire message is on one line
3. Check for trailing commas or extra characters

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting the DEBUG environment variable:

```bash
cd server
DEBUG=1 npm run start
```

This will show more detailed log messages to help diagnose issues.

## Success Criteria Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the server is working correctly:

- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Logs "Team Think MCP Server started"
- [ ] Logs "MCP server is ready to accept connections"  
- [ ] Responds to initialize request with correct protocol version
- [ ] Handles initialized notification without errors
- [ ] Returns empty tools list for tools/list request
- [ ] Returns error response for invalid methods
- [ ] Handles malformed JSON gracefully
- [ ] Shuts down gracefully with Ctrl+C
- [ ] All logs go to stderr (not mixed with JSON responses)

## Next Steps

Once manual testing confirms the server works correctly, you can:

1. **Integrate with MCP Client**: Connect the server to Claude Code or another MCP-compatible client
2. **Add Tools**: Implement the `chat_gemini` and `chat_chatgpt` tools
3. **Add WebSocket Server**: Enable browser extension communication

## Support

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:
