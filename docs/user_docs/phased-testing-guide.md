# Phased Testing Guide for Team Think MCP

## IMPORTANT: Implementation Status
This guide is divided into phases matching the actual implementation. Only test the phases that have been completed!

---

## Phase 3.1 Testing (‚úÖ CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED)

### What Works in Phase 3.1
- Browser extension loads without errors
- Options page for auth token configuration
- WebSocket connection to MCP server
- Authentication with security token

### What DOESN'T Work Yet
- ‚ùå Opening browser tabs
- ‚ùå Injecting prompts
- ‚ùå Capturing responses
- ‚ùå Full end-to-end flow

### How to Test Phase 3.1

1. **Build Everything**
   ```bash
   cd "/mnt/c/VS Code Projects/Code Web Chat/CodeWebChat/team-think-mcp"
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the MCP Server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```
   Copy the auth token that appears.

3. **Load the Extension**
   - Open Chrome
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable Developer mode
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `extension/dist` folder

4. **Configure the Extension**
   - Click on extension options
   - Paste the auth token
   - Click Save
   - Should show "‚úì Connected"

### Expected Results for Phase 3.1
‚úÖ Extension loads without errors  
‚úÖ Options page saves token  
‚úÖ Shows "Connected" status  
‚ùå No browser tabs will open (not implemented yet)  
‚ùå No prompts will be injected (not implemented yet)

## Phase 3.2-3.5 Testing (üöß NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

### What Will Be Added
- Message handling for `send-prompt`
- Browser tab creation
- Message passing to content scripts

### How to Test (AFTER IMPLEMENTATION)
Follow the same steps as Phase 3.1, then:

1. **Check Service Worker Console**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click "service worker" on the extension
   - Look for console messages like:
     - "[WebSocket] Received send-prompt"
     - "[TabManager] Creating tab for gemini"

2. **Run Test Client**
   ```bash
   cd server
   node better-test.js
   ```

### Expected Results
‚úÖ Console shows "Received send-prompt" messages  
‚úÖ New browser tabs open  
‚ùå Prompts NOT injected yet  
‚ùå Responses NOT captured yet  

---

## Phase 4 Testing (üöß NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

### What Will Be Added
- Login detection
- Prompt injection
- Response monitoring
- Full end-to-end flow

### How to Test (AFTER IMPLEMENTATION)
This is when the full manual-testing-guide.md will apply!

### Expected Results
‚úÖ Everything from previous phases  
‚úÖ Prompts appear in AI chats  
‚úÖ Responses captured and returned  
‚úÖ Full end-to-end flow works  

---

## Current Testing Status (As of Phase 3.1)

### ‚úÖ What You CAN Test Now
1. Extension installation
2. Auth token configuration
3. Connection status
4. Server startup and token generation

### ‚ùå What You CANNOT Test Yet
1. Sending prompts to AI services
2. Browser tab automation
3. Response capture
4. End-to-end flow

### If Things Don't Work
- **"No browser tabs open"** - This is EXPECTED until Phase 3.2-3.5
- **"Nothing happens when I send a prompt"** - This is EXPECTED until Phase 4
- **"Extension not connecting"** - This is a real issue, check:
  - Server is running
  - Token is correct
  - Using `localhost` not `127.0.0.1`

## When to Use Which Guide

1. **Use THIS guide (phased-testing-guide.md)** while implementation is in progress
2. **Use manual-testing-guide.md** only after ALL phases are complete
3. **Check implementation status** in `/docs/plan.md` to see what's done

## Quick Implementation Check
Run this to see what's implemented:
```bash
cat /mnt/c/VS\ Code\ Projects/Code\ Web\ Chat/CodeWebChat/team-think-mcp/docs/plan.md | grep -E "^\s*- \[[xX]\]"
```

Phases with [x] are implemented and can be tested.
